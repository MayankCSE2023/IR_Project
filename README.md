## Training the Model

# Training the Model

1. **Dataset Preparation**: We gathered a dataset containing images of 56 different food classes. Each class has a variety of images. We ensured that the dataset was properly labeled and divided it into three parts: 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Before feeding the images into the model, we resized them to a standard size of 224x224 pixels and normalized their pixel values. Additionally, we performed data augmentation techniques like rotation and flipping to increase the diversity of the dataset.
   
3. **Model Selection**: For this task, we opted for transfer learning using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). We chose the VGG16 architecture as it is well-suited for image classification tasks.
   
4. **Transfer Learning**: We loaded the pre-trained VGG16 model without the top classification layers. Then, we added custom classification layers on top of the convolutional base to adapt the model to our specific food classification task.
   
5. **Model Compilation**: To train the model, we compiled it using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, which is suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
   
6. **Model Training**: Training the model involved iterating over the training data while validating its performance on the validation set. Throughout the training process, we monitored key metrics such as accuracy and loss to assess the model's performance.
   
7. **Model Evaluation**: Finally, we evaluated the trained model on the test set to obtain a final assessment of its performance.

# Model Deployment and Classification

1. **Model Conversion**: After training, we converted the trained Keras model to TensorFlow Lite format. This step is crucial for deploying the model on mobile devices due to its reduced size and optimized inference capabilities.
   
2. **Integration into Android App**: We seamlessly integrated the TensorFlow Lite model into our Android app. We added the model file (model.tflite) to the assets directory of our Android project.
   
3. **Load Model in Android**: Within the Android app, we wrote code to load the TensorFlow Lite model from the assets directory and create an interpreter for inference.
   
4. **Image Preprocessing**: Before passing images to the model for classification, we preprocessed them by resizing, normalizing, and converting them to the appropriate format (e.g., bitmap).
   
5. **Inference**: Using the TensorFlow Lite interpreter, we performed inference on the preprocessed images, obtaining classification results in the form of predicted class probabilities.
   
6. **Post-processing**: We processed the inference results as needed, such as mapping predicted class indices to class labels or filtering results based on confidence thresholds.
   
7. **User Feedback**: Finally, we presented the classification results to the user within the Android app interface, potentially incorporating them into a recommendation system or providing further analysis based on the classification.
